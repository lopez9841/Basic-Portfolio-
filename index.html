        <p>
            My name is Jason Lopez and I was born and raised in philadelphia. I grew up with the majority of my youth devoted to playing soccer with the 
            aspirations for one day to play professional. Although I knew that was what I wanted to do which I still play today for fun, I also had my 
            education in mind and thankfully, later in life I was able to achieve both. I received a scholarship from Holy Family University for my academics 
            as well as for playing soccer. Upon graduating with a Bachelors in Finance I worked at several different companies. I currently work as an accountant at 
            a small bank in Cherry Hill, NJ called 1st Colonial. For the last year or so I have been imagining the idea of working as a software developer. I have
            always like the idea of creating something or atleast being able to be a part of something bigger than myself and I thought what better way than joining
            the tech industry.

            In this day and age we cant wake up without the thought of checking our phones first thing in the morning (even for the alarm lol!). I subscribed to platforms like datacamp
            and continue to this day to read about finance professionals that have moved from finance to tech in order to convince myself if this was the right move and countless of the
            articles I read always ended with the fact that they were so content with the move and would never look back. Once I knew this was what I wanted to do I joined this program and 
            looking to get to work to achieve success.
